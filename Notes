1) Targetting dipping point noted
2) Omit caspius
3) Only pH accurately quantified in the field
4) Rhynes are fairly uniform
5) Are differences in abundances of mosquitoes likely due to the shaded percentage area? Or is it correlative with those plants that cause shaded areas to occur?
6) An. Maculipennis consistently present in areas with less shade and shallower water - Steffi suggests likes warmer water
7) Combine Centre and Edge depth into a water volume variable
8) Drop Exposure
9) Test if management tier has a significant effect on the abundance of vegetation?
10) Steffi agrees landcover seems useless and probably linked to overfitting
11) Drop Newts and Fish. Samplign method isnt accurate to account for these, large mobile predators
12) Ellenberg variables all calculated from the site level cover weighted methods. Also agree that Ellenbergs are poor predictors. 
13) Other actual recorded vars might be better like Steffi suggests
14) WbL under represented
